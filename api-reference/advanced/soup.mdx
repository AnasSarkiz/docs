## Overview

"tscircuit soup" is the name of the built low-level JSON circuit representation. It contains
all the information needed to visually represent a schematic, PCB, produce Gerber files, produce
bill of materials, run SPICE simulations, view warnings and more. It is designed to easily
interoperate with a SQL database.

tscircuit soup is an array of objects, a tscircuit soup object looks like this:

```json
{
  "type": "source_component",
  "ftype": "simple_resistor",
  "source_component_id": "source_component_1",
  "name": "R1"
}
```

Typically a component like a resistor will be made up of many soup objects. All tscircuit
components (from the API reference section) have methods that convert themselves into soup.
Sometimes a component will analyze the soup produce by it's children to produce it's own
soup. For example, a `<group />` will build soup for it's children, then route traces.

### Units

You can use any standard unit e.g. `0.1in` or `2.54mm`, these are automatically
translated to the numeric value for the "default unit" after parsing.
